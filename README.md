# Rainfall-Prediction
Rainfall Prediction Using Meterological Data
The Rain in Australia dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. Daily Weather Observations list observations of a number of weather elements each day for a month. Included are daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall, strongest wind gust, evaporation, and sunshine, together with values at 9am and 3pm of temperature, humidity, wind, cloud and pressure. These observations are originally taken from the Bureau of Meteorology's "real time" system.

**AIM & OBJECTIVES**

The aim of this project is to use the data from Bureau of Meteorology to build a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the same location the next day.
